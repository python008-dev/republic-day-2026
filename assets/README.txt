ASSETS DIRECTORY
================

This directory is for storing media files used by the Republic Day website.

IMPORTANT: National Anthem File
-------------------------------
Please add the national anthem audio file (Jana Gana Mana) as:
  assets/anthem.mp3

You can download a respectful, official version of the Indian National Anthem
from authorized sources and place it in this directory.

Note: The website will work without the audio file, but the Flag Ceremony 
section will show the audio player with a message if the file is missing.

For images of freedom fighters, you can add them to the assets/images/ 
directory and update the JavaScript to use image paths instead of emojis.
